Installed Docker in order to run PostgreSQL without directly installing it.
For Docker I first had to upgrade my Windows to the latest version.
So what I did is I pulled latest PosgreSQL Docker image 
Then created a docker container for database and named in madina-db
Made sure that it was running
Accessed it and there created a new database calle madina and connected it
There I created a timetable table and inserted sample data for courses
Creating Flask Web Application:
First created a virtual environment and activated it
Installed flask and pg
Then I went to VS Code to create files like python and html
Next step was to dockerize the app
I build docker image then run the container
I had some errors at first, so i modified code a little bit and tried one more time, then I got the output you can see below
I had a trouble with displaying courses
I tried modifing code, checking the database whther all info is there, but i still have this error
